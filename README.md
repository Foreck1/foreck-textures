# Foreck's Textures

A collection of textures I've created over the past few years since I started working on the MC modpack Rebirth of the Night. All of these textures are available under a GPLv3 compat license, meaning you are free to use them in your own mods, modpacks, or other projects.

This collection includes a fair amount of unique weapons, items and blocks. There are also non-standard textures used for custom models made with Blockbench for blocks and mobs. Most of these are used in Rebirth of the Night, but others are also used in published mods and modpacks alike, as well as some that are completely unused.
